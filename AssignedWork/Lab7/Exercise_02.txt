1. The tree is not full as several nodes (F, G, etc.) have only 1 child
2. The tree is not complete as levels that are not the last (2, 3, and 4) are not fully filled
3. Not balanced as node F has a height difference of 2
4. The tree is not perfect as not all internal nodes have 2 children
5. No, node E is 0 while node D is 17 which violates the property of the BST that says the right child in a given node must be greater than the given node's value
6. No because the tree is not a BST
