Q 01.1
A stack is efficient for this task because parentheses follow a nested structure where the most recently opened bracket must be closed first.
Given the stack's LIFO property, this perfectly mirrors this requirement

Q 03.1
I would use two stacks, one to store all the elements, another to track the minimum element at each level.
To start, the minStack will have the first element in the main stack stored in it. Once new elements are added, I will use minStack.peek to check if the new element is less than the element in the stack.
Once a user calls getMin, I can use minStack.peek to return the minimum element. 
This works due to the LIFO property of stacks - adding new elements to minStack will always be less than the previous element and peek will return the last element added which will be the smallest.
