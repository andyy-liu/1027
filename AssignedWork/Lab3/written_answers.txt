Q 02.1
User 1: ID = 0, Username = alice
User 2: ID = 1, Username = bob
User 3: ID = 2, Username = charlie
Total number of instances created: 3
User 4: ID = 3, Username = david
User 5: ID = 4, Username = eve
Total number of instances created: 5

Q 02.2
The password should be an instance variable - each user needs their own unique password so it cannot bs static.
Password should not be final so users can change their passwords for security reasons.

To update it, we could make a public void updatePassword method with params oldPassword and newPassword, both strings.
If oldPassword is equal to their old password, we would change the password to the new password.

Q 03.1
Method signatures have to be unique because the Java compiler uses them to determine which method to call at compile time.
If we write non unique signatures, we will get a compile-time error because there are ambiguous cases.

Area of triangle (base 6, height 4): 12.0

Q 03.3
Improved readabilty - users dont have to remember multiple method names, they can just use their appropriate parameters
Better code organization - all area functionality is grouped under a single method name
Scalability - easy to add new shapes without disruption previous methods or new method names

Q 04.1
ChildClass.java attempts to override the printMessage method from ParentClass which will not work because it is declared as final.
We could fix it by removing final from parent class or use a different method name in ChildClass
