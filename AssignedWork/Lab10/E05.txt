1. Descendants: 46, 42, 55
Ancestors: 41, 60

2. Find the largest node in the left subtree of 53 and swap the positions then delete the 53.
This would then be 46, left child 42, right child 55

3. 25, 42, 55, 62, 64, 70

4. 60, 41, 16, 53, 46, 74, 65, 63

5. 60, 41, 74, 16, 53, 65, 25, 46, 55, 63, 70, 42, 62, 64,  

6. 
Preorder: 60, 41, 16, 25, 53, 46, 42, 55, 74, 65, 63, 62, 64, 70
Inorder: 25, 16, 41, 42, 46, 53, 55, 60, 62, 63, 64, 65, 70, 74
Postorder: 25, 16, 42, 46, 55, 53, 41, 62, 64, 63, 70, 65, 74, 60

7. Using the Windows OS as an example, the root directory "C:\" can serve as the root noe of the tree.
Each subdirectory becomes a child node and files become leaf nodes under their containing directory.
Each tree node could have file system information like name, type, permissions, size, etc. Directory nodes would have points to their children,
while file nodes would be leaf nodes.
