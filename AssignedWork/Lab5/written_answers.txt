Q 02.1
The iterative method is faster. This is not too surprising because the program we are implementing is relatively simple.
The iterative approach uses a constant memory space, regardless of input size which might explain why its faster in simpler operations.

Q 02.2
If our base case is not properly defined, the program could continue forever as the base case is what tells the program to stop.
If the program continues forever, we will reach a StackOverflow error because the JVM runs out of memory.

Q 03.2
Number of palindromes found: 20
