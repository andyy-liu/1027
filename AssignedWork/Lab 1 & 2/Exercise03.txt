byte1 is not valid because bytes are 8-bit signed integers which can only go from -128 to +127.
byte2 is valid as -127 is in the 8-bit signed integer range

short2 is not valid because it is out of range of the 16-bit signed integer.
short1 is valid because it is in the 16-bit signed integer range (-32,768 to +32,767)

int2 is not valid because it is out of range of the 32-bit signed integer.
int1 is valid because it is in range of the 32-bit signed integer (-2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647)

long2 is not valid because it does not have the 'L' at the end which is required to compile
long1 is valid because it has an 'L' at the end

float2 is not valid because it does not have an 'F' at the end to differentiate itself from a double
float1 is valid because it has an 'F' at the end

double2 is not valid because it is wrapped in quotations which makes it a String
double1 is valid because it is a floating point with no 'F', nor wrapped in quotation marks

char4 is not valid because it contains a several unicode characters instead of a single unicode character
char1, char2, char3, are all valid as they either contain a single unicode character or the proper format of denoting a unicode character

bool2 is not valid because the F is uppercase
