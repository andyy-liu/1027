Q 01.1
This ensures the instance variables cannot be accessed from other places, only the class it is declared in.
This gives us privacy and security, not letting other programs directly see / modify the data.

Q 01.2
We want the methods to be public so that other programs that use our class can call our methods.
If they were private, they would not be able to call our methods, blocking all the functionality of our class.

Q 01.3
Yes, assuming they took unique arguments there could be more than one constructor

Q 02.1
No because Arrays are a fixed size after being created. This means we cannot add or remove elements which is not practical for a library.

Q 02.2
We would have to add an availability status to track whether or not a book can be borrowed.
This could be a isAvailable boolean value set to true by default
We would have to implement a borrowBook method and returnBook method.
borrowBook would check if the book exists in the library and check if it is available.
- if available, switch the boolean to false
- if not available, print a string saying the book is currently checked out.
returnBook would check if the book exists and if its currently checked out.
- if checked out, switch the boolean to true
- if not checked out, print a string saying the book has not been checked out
